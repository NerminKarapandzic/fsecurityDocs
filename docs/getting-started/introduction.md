# About fsecurity

The idea of this library is to be a simple and lightweight alternative to Spring Security.

It is not a replacement for Spring Security, nor it can compare to it in terms of features, but it is a good alternative
if you want to set up a simple authentication mechanism quickly.

As someone who has used Spring Security I know how painful it was when just getting started.
It is a very powerful framework with lots of features, but it is also very unfriendly to beginners.

The biggest complaint I have about Spring Security is that it's documentation is huge, scattered around many
places, outdated and mostly irrelevant. It is very hard to find what you are looking for.

This is why I decided to create fsecurity, a simple alternative to Spring Security, that is easy to use and get started with.
